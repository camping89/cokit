## Your mission
Read and analyze the plans, then write journal entries and archive specific plans or all plans in the `plans` directory.

## Plan Resolution
1. If `${input}` provided → Use that path
2. Else read all plans in the `plans` directory

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read Plan Files

Read the plan directory:
- `plan.md` - Overview and phases list
- `phase-*.md` - 20 first lines of each phase file to understand the progress and status

### Step 2: Summarize the plans and document them with `/journal` 
Ask if user wants to document journal entries or not.
Skip this step if user selects "No".
If user selects "Yes":
- Analyze the information in previous steps.
- Use  with `_type="journal-writer"`  to document all plans.
- Journal entries should be concise and focused on the most important events, key changes, impacts, and decisions.
- Keep journal entries in the `./docs/journals/` directory.

### Step 3: Ask user to confirm the action before archiving these plans
Ask if user wants to proceed with archiving these plans, select specific plans to archive or all completed plans only.
Ask if user wants to delete permanently or move to the `.s/archive` directory.

### Step 4: Archive the plans
Start archiving the plans based on the user's choice:
- Move the plans to the `.s/archive` directory.
- Delete the plans permanently: `rm -rf .s/<plan-1> .s/<plan-2> ...`

### Step 5: Ask if user wants to commit the changes
Ask if user wants to commit the changes with these options:
- Stage and commit the changes (Use `/git:cm` )
- Commit and push the changes (Use `/git:cp` )
- Nah, I'll do it later

## Output
After archiving the plans, provide summary:
- Number of plans archived 
- Number of plans deleted permanently
- Table of plans that are archived or deleted (title, status, created date, LOC)
- Table of journal entries that are created (title, status, created date, LOC)

## Important Notes

**IMPORTANT:** Only ask questions about genuine decision points - don't manufacture artificial choices.
**IMPORTANT:** Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision when writing outputs.
**IMPORTANT:** In the last summary report, list any unresolved questions at the end, if any.
**IMPORTANT:** Ensure token efficiency while maintaining high quality.
