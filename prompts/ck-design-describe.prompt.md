Think hard to describe the design based on this screenshot/video:
<screenshot>${input}</screenshot>

## Required Skills (Priority Order)
1. **`ui-ux-pro-max`** - Design intelligence database (ALWAYS ACTIVATE FIRST)
2. **`frontend-design`** - Visual analysis

**Ensure token efficiency while maintaining high quality.**

## Workflow:
1. 
   - Be specific about design style, every element, elements' positions, every interaction, every animation, every transition, every color, every border, every icon, every font style, font size, font weight, every spacing, every padding, every margin, every size, every shape, every texture, every material, every light, every shadow, every reflection, every refraction, every blur, every glow, every image, background transparency, etc.
   - **IMPORTANT:** Try to predict the font name (Google Fonts) and font size in the given screenshot, don't just use Inter or Poppins.
2. create a design implementation plan following the progressive disclosure structure so the result matches the screenshot/video:
   - Create a directory using naming pattern from `## Naming` section.
   - Save the overview access point at `plan.md`, keep it generic, under 80 lines, and list each phase with status/progress and links.
   - For each phase, add `phase-XX-phase-name.md` files containing sections (Context links, Overview with date/priority/statuses, Key Insights, Requirements, Architecture, Related code files, Implementation Steps, Todo list, Success Criteria, Risk Assessment, Security Considerations, Next steps).
3. Report back to user with a summary of the plan.
