# Debugging Skill

This skill teaches Copilot systematic debugging approaches.

## When to Activate

- User reports a bug or error
- Code isn't working as expected
- User asks to "fix" something

## Core Rule

**NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE FIRST**

## Debugging Process

1. **Understand** - What's expected vs actual?
2. **Reproduce** - Can you trigger the issue?
3. **Isolate** - Where does it fail?
4. **Root Cause** - Why does it fail?
5. **Fix** - Make minimal change
6. **Verify** - Test the fix works

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Random changes hoping something works
- Fixing symptoms instead of causes
- Skipping reproduction step
- Not verifying the fix
