## Pre-Creation Check (Active vs Suggested Plan Detection)

Check the `## Plan Context` section in the injected context:
- If "Plan:" shows a path → Active plan exists. Ask user: "Active plan found: {path}. Continue with this? [Y/n]"
- If "Suggested:" shows a path → Branch-matched plan hint only. Ask user if they want to activate it or create new.
- If "Plan: none" → Proceed to create new plan using naming pattern from `## Naming` section.

## Workflow
- Analyze the given task and use `AskUserQuestion` tool to ask for more details if needed.
- Activate `planning` skill.
- Note: `detailed-instructions-prompt` is **an enhanced prompt** that describes the task in detail based on the provided task description.
