## Purpose

Utilize external agentic tools to scout given directories or explore the codebase for files needed to complete the task using a fast, token efficient agent.

## Variables

USER_PROMPT: $1
SCALE: $2 (defaults to 3)
RELEVANT_FILE_OUTPUT_DIR: Use `Report:` from `## Naming` section

## Workflow:
- 5-flash-preview-09-2025` (if count <= 3)
  - `opencode run "[prompt]" --model opencode/grok-code` (if count > 3 and count < 6)
  - if count >= 6, spawn s to search the codebase 

**Why use external agentic tools?**
- External agentic tools are faster and more efficient when using LLMs with large context windows (1M+ tokens).

**How to prompt the agents:**
- If `gemini` or `opencode` is not available, ask the user if they want to install it:
  - If **yes**, install it (if there are permission issues, instruct the user to install it manually, including authentication steps)
  - If **no**, use the default s.
- IMPORTANT: Kick these agents off  using the , analyze and divide folders for each agent to scout intelligently and quickly.
- IMPORTANT: These agents are calling OTHER agentic coding tools to search the codebase. DO NOT call any search tools yourself.
- IMPORTANT: That means )
- IMPORTANT: Instruct the agents to quickly search the codebase for files needed to complete the task. This isn't about a full blown search, just a quick search to find the files needed to complete the task.
- Instruct the  use a timeout of 3 minutes for each agent's bash call. Skip any agents that don't return within the timeout, don't restart them.
- **IMPORTANT:** Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision when writing reports.
- **IMPORTANT:** In reports, list any unresolved questions at the end, if any.
