# Solution Design

How to design solutions before implementing.

## Design Process

### 1. Define Scope

- What's included?
- What's excluded?
- What's the MVP?
- What's future work?

### 2. Architecture

- High-level structure
- Component breakdown
- Data flow
- Integration points

### 3. Consider Alternatives

For each major decision:
- Option A: [description]
- Option B: [description]
- Recommendation: [choice + reasoning]

### 4. Trade-offs

Document trade-offs:
- Performance vs simplicity
- Flexibility vs complexity
- Speed vs quality

## Design Output

### Architecture Document

```markdown
## Overview
[1-2 sentences]

## Components
- Component A: [purpose]
- Component B: [purpose]

## Data Flow
[diagram or description]

## Key Decisions
- Decision 1: [choice + why]
- Decision 2: [choice + why]

## Trade-offs
- [trade-off 1]
- [trade-off 2]
```

## Quality Checks

- [ ] Scope clear?
- [ ] Components defined?
- [ ] Alternatives considered?
- [ ] Trade-offs documented?
- [ ] Fits existing patterns?
