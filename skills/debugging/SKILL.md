# Debugging Skill

This skill teaches Copilot systematic debugging approaches.

## When to Activate

- User reports a bug or error
- Code isn't working as expected
- User asks to "fix" something

## Approach

1. Understand the expected vs actual behavior
2. Reproduce the issue
3. Find root cause (not just symptoms)
4. Make minimal fix
5. Verify the fix works
