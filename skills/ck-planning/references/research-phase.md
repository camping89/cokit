# Research Phase

How to properly research before planning.

## Goals

- Understand problem space
- Find existing solutions
- Identify constraints
- Avoid reinventing wheels

## Research Steps

### 1. Understand Requirements

- What exactly needs to be built?
- What's the success criteria?
- What are the constraints?
- Who are the stakeholders?

### 2. Research Existing Solutions

- How do others solve this?
- What libraries/tools exist?
- What patterns are common?
- What pitfalls to avoid?

### 3. Analyze Codebase

- What exists already?
- What patterns are used?
- What can be reused?
- What needs to change?

### 4. Identify Risks

- What could go wrong?
- What's uncertain?
- What needs clarification?
- What are blockers?

## Research Output

Document findings:
- Problem summary
- Existing solutions
- Recommended approach
- Risks and mitigations
- Open questions

## Quality Checks

- [ ] Requirements clear?
- [ ] Alternatives considered?
- [ ] Risks identified?
- [ ] Questions listed?
